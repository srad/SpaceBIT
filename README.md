Space.BIT is a 3d space shooter based on the [jMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/) 3d game engine.

This game was part of an exercise in my computer graphics course at the Goethe-University in Frankfurt, Germany.

For a playable build of the game and more details visit my blog at: [ssrad.org](http://ssrad.org/spacebit)
