Space.BIT is a 3D space shooter based on the [jMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/) game engine.

This game was part of a computer graphics course in early 2012 and has been updated in early 2020 to make it just work with Java 11 + jMonjeyEngine 3.20.

# Quickstart

Install Gradle and Java 11

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srad/SpaceBIT.git

gradle run

# Code

* Base on Java 1.6 at that time.
* Notice that the code design choices I made differ from the official recommendations made in the jMonkeyEngine documentation I made the decision to keep the source compact for this small project.
* The source is of course not fully fleshed out, it was only written during the course. I might continue working on it in the future, feel free to send pull requests.

# Copyrights

* Notice the copyright notices in the game and handbook.
* All assets, except the monkey head, the music and the sounds, has been created by me with Blender and Gimp and can be freely used for non commercial purposes.
